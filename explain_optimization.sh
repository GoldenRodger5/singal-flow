# üîç WHAT YOUR RAILWAY API SERVER ACTUALLY DOES vs FULL TRADING SYSTEM

echo "üèóÔ∏è  RAILWAY API SERVER (railway_start.py) - WHAT IT DOES:"
echo "============================================================"
echo "‚úÖ Serves 11 API endpoints for dashboard:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ /api/holdings - Get current positions from Alpaca"  
echo "   ‚Ä¢ /api/account - Get account info from Alpaca"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ /api/trades/active - Get active orders"

echo "‚úÖ What packages it ACTUALLY uses:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ fastapi/uvicorn - Serve API endpoints"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ pymongo - Connect to MongoDB for data"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ alpaca-trade-api - Get trading data"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ pandas/numpy - Basic data formatting"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ requests - HTTP calls to external APIs"

echo "‚ùå What it DOESN'T do:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ NO machine learning analysis (uses external AI APIs)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ NO complex technical analysis (basic market data only)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ NO UI rendering (Vercel frontend handles that)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ NO trading execution (that's your local main.py)"

echo "üñ•Ô∏è  LOCAL TRADING SYSTEM (main.py) - THE FULL SYSTEM:"
echo "======================================================"
echo "‚úÖ This is where ALL the heavy lifting happens:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Complex ML analysis (needs scikit-learn, numba)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Technical indicators (needs pandas-ta, plotly)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Trading decisions and execution"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Market analysis and AI reasoning"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Risk management calculations"

echo "üöÄ RAILWAY (API Server Only):"
echo "   - 15 lightweight packages"  
echo "   - ~50-100MB dependencies"

echo "Your Railway is just a 'data API' for your dashboard."

echo ""
echo "‚úÖ WE REMOVED NOTHING YOU NEED!"
echo "Every removed package was either:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Development tools (jupyter, pytest)"
echo "‚Ä¢ UI libraries (streamlit, plotly) - your frontend is Next.js"  
echo "‚Ä¢ Heavy ML libs (scikit-learn) - you use OpenAI/Claude APIs"
echo "‚Ä¢ Optional features (Twitter/Reddit APIs)"
