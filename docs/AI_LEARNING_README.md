## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring Your AI

### Learning Dashboard
Access the comprehensive dashboard at `http://localhost:8001/docs`

Key endpoints:
- `/api/learning/status` - Overall learning system status
- `/api/learning/metrics` - Detailed performance metrics  
- `/api/learning/performance` - Win rate, accuracy, P&L analytics

### Daily Reports
The AI automatically generates daily reports sent via WhatsApp including:
- Prediction accuracy trends
- Win rate improvements
- Key insights and recommendations
- Strategy optimization suggestions

## ðŸ§  How The Learning Works

### 1. Decision Logging Phase
Every time the AI considers a trade:
- Records complete reasoning chain (RSI, VWAP, sentiment, etc.)
- Logs confidence score and prediction details
- Captures market context and conditions

### 2. Outcome Analysis Phase  
When trades complete:
- Compares actual results to AI predictions
- Calculates accuracy scores for each signal type
- Identifies which reasoning factors were most/least reliable

### 3. Learning Phase (Daily)
- Analyzes pattern performance across all completed trades
- Updates signal weights based on what's actually working
- Adjusts confidence calibration to be more accurate
- Uses validation splits to prevent overfitting

### 4. Strategy Validation (Weekly)
- Backtests current AI strategy against historical data
- Compares performance to alternative approaches
- Implements improvements that pass validation testing

## ðŸ”’ Overfitting Prevention

The system includes multiple safeguards against overfitting:

### Conservative Learning Rate (10%)
- AI only adjusts weights by small amounts each cycle
- Prevents dramatic changes from small sample sizes

### Validation Splits (30%)
- 30% of data reserved for validation
- Changes only applied if they improve validation performance

### Minimum Sample Requirements
- AI waits for 20+ trades before making major adjustments
- Pattern analysis requires minimum 5 occurrences

### Decay Factors
- Older data gradually loses influence
- Prevents AI from getting stuck on outdated patterns
